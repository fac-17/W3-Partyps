## Installation manual 

## User Journey 
**Happy Scenario** 
- User types a party theme into search bar (example: "Mexican") and clicks "Let's go" button 
- App suggests a playlist and a recipe corresponding to the search term 
- User can access playlist and recipe by clicking on the respective titles
- User can clear search by clicking "Clear" buttoon 
- User can enter new search term and receives new playlist & recipe suggestions

**Edge Cases** 
- If no search term provided, alert message pops up and
- If user provides invalid search term, alert message pops up and input field is clear 
(bug to fix: app will still suggest a playlist based on invalid search term)
